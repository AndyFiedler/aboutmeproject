    <header><h1>Meet Mr. A Fiedler</h1></header>
    <p><H2><My name is Andrew Lee Fiedler. The Andrew is pronounced <strong>"Andy"</strong>, and the Fiedler is pronounced <strong>"Fiddler".</strong>
        Remember that well because I tolerate mispronunciations poorly. I have seen 28 winters and am starting to kinda
        get tired of them. Literally <em>any</em> other season is splendid compared to all that mess. I have none kids and many animals.
        Animals are just way less tiring than humans. Except my german shepherd and best frenemy, Rondo; he's the worst. Kids are less frivolous than adult 
        humans so I enjoy their company too, though the cost of ownership seems a little high. One day I'd like like an indoor greenhouse
        with like critters running around doing their thing amoung the foliage. Maybe a monkey or a parrot too. A robot, potentially. </H2>
